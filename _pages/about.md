```bash
echo "Hello World!"
```
devops engineer focused on automation, containerized infrastructures and secure operations  
I use kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines and observability tools to build stable, maintainable and easily scalable systems  

I have contributed to both product teams and infrastructure projects, with experience in provisioning, system hardening and backend scripting

I am also experienced in integrating monitoring, logging and security tools in multi-environment setups  
I enjoy working in small technical teams where infrastructure is an integral part of the product, not just a support layer

I am a person with strong ethics and morals, which I want to be the first point of resonance with the workplace
